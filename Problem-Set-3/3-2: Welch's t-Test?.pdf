Q: Does entries data from the previous exercise seem normally distributed? 
A: No

Can we run Welch's T test on entries data? Why or why not?
A: Yes, we can run Welch's T test on entries data. It does not assume 
that the sample sizes are equal or that they have the same variance. This 
test can see the probability of obtaining a good test statistic before we look 
to prove if the hypothesis could be true.
